# XeHideawayLogger

### What the hell is this?
This is a packet interceptor for the game 'Hotel Hideaway' by Sulake.

Currently it's a very basic program, I don't have much interest in this game so don't expect wonders.

### Ok how can I get it working?
Check the wiki for instructions on Android. It should be similar on IOS but I can't test so good luck!

### Some code in there looks FAMILIAR to me!
Yeah I took some of it from sirjonasxx's G-Earth, more specifically the whole HPacket class and some of the connection logic.

Nice and simple!
